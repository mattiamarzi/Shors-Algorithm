The purpose of this project is to create a Python code to execute the Shor's quantum factorization algorithm. To achieve this goal, I have utilized the Qiskit SDK, an open-source service that provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum circuits, interfacing classical programming languages with the quantum computers available through the IBM Q Experience.

The code you find is used to factorize the number N = 15 using 12 qubits to perform the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm and the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm.

The following image is a representation of the circuit I built to perform the algorithm.
